        <p>
          If you are thinking of buying a new home, it is very important that you seek the services of a qualified structural engineer to evaluate the state of the structure of your potential new residence.
        </p>
        &nbsp;
        <p>
          If you're applying for a home loan, chances that an inspection report is required by your lender. But even if you are paying cash for your home and have no contractual requirement to  provide an integrity report, not ordering one could be a  mistake.
        </p>

        <p>
          A qualified  engineer as one from Kering Associate Engineers will check the condition of foundations, bearing walls/columns, slabs, and roofs of the structure, cellar (for unwanted water among other things), and the existence of a waste water disposal system and myriad of other details as well as possible termite infestation.
        </p>
        &nbsp;
        <p>
          The latter is very important; a seemingly solid house can be weakened structurally, sometimes beyond repair, if a termite problem is not detected and resolved early.
