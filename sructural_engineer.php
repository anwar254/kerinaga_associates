            	Structural engineers analyze, design, plan, and research structural components and structural systems to achieve design goals and ensure the safety and comfort of users or occupants. Structural engineers take into account mainly safety, technical, economic and environmental concerns, but they may also consider aesthetic and social factors.

            	Typical structures designed by a structural engineer in this case Kering Associate Engineers limited include buildings, towers, stadia and bridges. Other structures such as oil rigs, space satellites, aircraft and ships may also be designed by a structural engineer.

              In the construction industry, structural engineers work closely with architects, civil engineers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, quantity surveyors, and construction managers.



              Structural engineers ensure that buildings and bridges are built to be strong enough and stable enough to resist all appropriate structural loads (e.g., gravity, wind, snow, rain, seismic (earthquake), earth pressure, temperature, and traffic) in order to prevent or reduce loss of life or injury. They also design structures to be stiff enough to not deflect or vibrate beyond acceptable limits.
